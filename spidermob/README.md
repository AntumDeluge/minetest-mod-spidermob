SPIDERMOB (lottmobs extracted)

I've extracted the spider mob of LordofTheTested minetest-subgame (viewtopic.php?f=15&t=5578), and i hope it will give you fun ! :)

So, it's a mod with just the spider, i've also make smalls modifications :
- updated the spider api.lua
- adjusted her HP for more stability (15 to 30)
- her jump step (now can jump over 1 block) 
- her drops for more stability and add raw_meat sometimes, much culture eats spiders after all (50% 1 to 2 string and 25% 1 to 2 meat_raw)
- add blood when hit
- add knock back when hit
- modified spawn, mostly in jungle. Be careful, they spawns in part on "default:leaves" so, sometimes they falls in your head !
